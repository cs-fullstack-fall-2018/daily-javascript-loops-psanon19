# Daily Question: JavaScript loops

Consider the following code:

```javascript
<script type="text/javascript">
  var theCounter = 15;
  while (theCounter > 0)
  {
    document.write("The count at this time is " + theCounter + "<br/>");
    theCounter--;
  }
</script>
```

### What is the expected result when you run this script in the browser?
A. There will be no visible output, but the script will count down to 0.

B. The script will output a countdown from 15 to 0 in the browser window.

C. The script will output a countdown from 15 to 1 in the browser window.

D. The script will output 15, then 1, because it will only write the first and last values of a ```while``` statement.

### THE ANSWER IS 'C'
